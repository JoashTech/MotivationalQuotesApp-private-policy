        <div class="data-flow">
            <h3>📊 Data Flow Transparency</h3>
            <p><strong>Our Role:</strong> We enable third-party services that may collect anonymized data</p>
            <p><strong>Their Role:</strong> Third-party services independently collect and process device data</p>
            <p>We do not collect, store, or process device data on our servers - this is handled directly by our partners according to their privacy policies.</p>
        </div>

            <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: If you submit feedback through the App, we may receive your email address and feedback content when you choose to submit via email.</li>
            <li><strong>Shared Content</strong>: When you share quotes or images, these are processed through your chosen sharing method (email, social media, etc.).</li>
